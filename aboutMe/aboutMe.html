 <p class ='letter'>“The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively.”
-Bob Marley

I know this is intended for career purposes, but this is just a short, authentic snippet of the man you have the opportunity to learn about today.

Caleb is an amazing, ever evolving, wonderful human being. I may be a little biased being his wife, but I truly believe that this man is going to change generations to come and leave an insanely remarkable legacy.
Knowing him since our freshmen year of high school and being his partner since then, I’ve had the privilege and experience of growing up with him here in Chattanooga.
I have witnessed him at some summits from leading our high school marching band, becoming a father and a husband, to previous job promotions and recognition at his current position.
I have also been there to witness him at some low moments. One example being betrayal from managers, friends, that he had simply trusted and put our future in the hands of only to have them be dishonest and take advantage of two kids seeking the American Dream. I’ve seen him handle the harsh judgements of loved ones who didn’t understand the sacrifices we were making to take our lives to another level, letting the unwanted criticisms roll off him like water off a duck’s back, and I’ve witnessed him handle the hardest critic of all: himself. He expects greatness from himself and holds himself accountable to his and our goals. He handles pressure like a diamond: he allows it to form him to something greater. Though only 23, I’ve seen him grow, “man up” if you will, in all facets of life. I only see his future, our future, getting better. He is far from perfect- I have seen that upfront as well; however, Caleb has never lacked work ethic, accountability, integrity, or hunger, and I feel like I’m constantly seeing more and more great things come from him. Even at his recent graduation from the Tech Workforce Program I realized how great he was at speaking and addressing crowds. He even looks great with a microphone! How far he’s come from being that coy, little, fourteen year old boy kicking pebbles at band camp whilst his mom talks to the band director.
I’ve learned many valuable lessons from him in terms of not only professionalism and developing a backbone, but also humility. He makes sure to do the right thing- even when I or others may think it’s minor, annoying, or “no bid deal.” What you see is what you get. He doesn’t believe in altering motives or ghosts. He makes himself available to people in need even if we have people trying to tell us it “isn’t our problem.”

Without a doubt, his future career path is brighter and more favorable than ever. I know he’s going far, and wherever he ends up will be extremely fortunate to have him as an asset.

Thank you for taking time to read this.
